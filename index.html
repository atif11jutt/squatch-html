            <p>It all started with your typical Kiwi lad who was in dire need of finding a club
                where he could work on his social skills and his passion to one day capture an
                image of the elusive creature known for it’s abnormally large feet. He
                searched far and wide, but alas, no such club existed. He came to the
                conclusion that there was only one solution to this problem.

                <br><br>
                The creation of an exclusive club for squatch enthusiasts around the world.

        </div>
        <div class="textbox" id="textbox-3">
            <p>Thus, The Social Squatch Club was born. With a bit of perseverance and some much
                needed alcoholic beverages, he was able to capture 8,888 Unique and absolutely
                absurd looking images of the one and only Sasquatch. With over 160+ hand-drawn
                traits, each Squatch will show its own individual take on social club attire.

                effort and difference they can make is amazing. Especially when you have a
                strong community behind it.

                This is why we want to donate $50,000 to Mental

                Awareness is just half of the legwork. We want to focus on actually bringing

                    NFT’s of the Social Squatch Club. This will open the golden gates to many advantages
                    and rewards. Being a High-Roller will also give you mad bragging rights that only a
