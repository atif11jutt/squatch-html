        <p>It all started with your typical Kiwi lad who was in dire need of finding a club where he could work on his social skills and his passion to one day capture an image of the elusive creature known for it’s abnormally large feet. He searched far and wide, but alas, to no success.  

            He came to a conclusion there was only one solution to this problem. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="textbox" id="textbox-3">
        <p>By starting his own Club, which soon came to be The Social Squatch Club. With a bit of perseverance and a much needed alcoholic beverage, he was able to capture 8,888 Unique and absolutely absurd looking images of the one and only - the Sasquatch. With over 160+ 
            hand-drawn traits, each Squatch will show its own individual take on social club attire.</p>

    <div class="textbox" id="textbox-4">
        <p>It’s time to create a community that finally puts those ape’s in their place! 

            We want to give 75% of secondary sales to go towards the community wallet and let the community decide what do with it.
            
            Not only this! But we want to reward our most engaged users in our 
            discord community with NFT’s as

        <p>
            Coming from the land down under, it has been a crazy journey grinding 9-5 on minimum wage, creating an NFT collection and having the dire need to give my boss the middle finger. 

            I came to the conclusion that I had to create a collection that leaves the community on the edge of their seat, biting your nails, wondering what the f*ck have the Social Club got planned for us next. Each step of the way is gonna be a completely new take of ideas and adventure that you as a community will not only help create but actually make a reality.
